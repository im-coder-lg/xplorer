# Installation

## Installer

You can access the installer [here](https://github.com/kimlimjustin/xplorer/releases).

## Common Problems

<details>
<summary>
Faced Windows Defender?
</summary>

This is actually not an error, it's a design choice by Microsoft to protect those of us who are not tech-savvy (i.e. potentially your friends) from a virus. You don't need to worry about the safety of Xplorer in this case since it's [open source](https://github.com/kimlimjustin/xplorer) and you can inspect the code or even build your own version!

To Handle this, you can just click the `More Info` button, then, just click Run Anyway.
