## Copy files

You can copy files by right-clicking it and click the `Copy` option or select the file then press `Ctrl + C` as a shortcut and paste it by clicking the `Paste` option or press `Ctrl + V` on the destination folder.

:::info

On Windows and macOS, Xplorer will copy the file paths into the local clipboard, because of this, you can copy a file from Xplorer and paste it into any folder in another system. However, on Linux, we create a string of Xplorer commands and copy it into the user clipboard, Xplorer will read the user's clipboard when pasting the file (because we haven't found any idea to implement it, feel free to [open a PR](/community/Contributing/#pull-requests) if you can help us). The string of the Xplorer command looks like this:

```
Xplorer command - COPY
~/xplorer
~/test
```

## Copy Location Path

You can copy a file/folder location path into your clipboard by right-clicking it and click `Copy Location Path` or select the file then press `Alt + Shift + C` as a shortcut.

## Cut files

You can cut files by right-clicking it and click the `Cut` option or select the file then press `Ctrl + X` as a shortcut and paste it by clicking the `Paste` option or press `Ctrl + V` on the destination folder.

:::info
This is done by creating a string of Xplorer command and copies it into the user clipboard to be used when pasting file (this is not integrated with the platform because we haven't found any idea, feel free to [open a PR](/community/Contributing/#pull-requests) if you can help us.). The string of Xplorer command looks like this:

```
Xplorer command - CUT
E://xplorer
E://test
```

## Delete files

You can cut files by right-clicking it and click the `Delete` option or select the file then press `Del` as a shortcut. The trashed file can be accessed at `xplorer://Trash`.

:::info

-   On Windows, this is done by creating a `Trash` folder on the `C:` drive and moving the file into it.
-   On Linux, this feature is fully integrated with the system.
-   On macOS, this is done by creating a `.local/Trash` folder on `homedir` and moving the file into it.

We are still working on Windows on macOS to integrate the `Trash` folder, which will be released before the stable version came out. Feel free to [open a PR](/community/Contributing/#pull-requests) if you can help us.
