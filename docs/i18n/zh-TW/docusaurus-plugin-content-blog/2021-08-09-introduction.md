I am very happy to introduce [Xplorer](https://xplorer.vercel.app) to help you organize your files/folders.

I created Xplorer for the following reasons:
* Support Multiple Tabs
* Easy to use
* Highly customizable (just like VSCode)
* Cross-platform
* Supports previewing apps directly inside Xplorer
* Looks modern
* Most importantly, FOSS, Free and Open Source, which means you can change components inside if you see it fit

Xplorer is an app designed to let users manage files/folders easily by supporting multiple tabs, previewing files and so on. Also, it looks modern! You can customize the application by changing the theme, icon and also plugin a custom function into Xplorer (though by the time I write this documentation, it's not done yet, but it will be soon)!

## 為何我製作此程式？

Back then, I was taught Python at my school and I found it interesting when I created the “Hello World” program and I posted  some tutorials on making things like Calculator and showoff to my friends XD. Soon after, Covid 19 came and I was bored and got a lot of time, I went to YouTube and learned how to program using PHP, then I switched to JavaScript and found its better.

One day, I found out the [Files](https://files-community.github.io/) and it’s awesome, I use it as my default file explorer. However, I found it quite laggy and at a certain version, it just doesn’t work on my laptop. I opened an issue but they asked me to reinstall windows 10 and they just closed [that Issue](https://github.com/files-community/Files/issues/4287) Meanwhile, I also tried dual-booting with Linux and found out the file manager of Linux is boring and I was unable to use any available file manager out there.

So, I asked myself, why don’t I build one that is a cross-platform, customizable and modern file manager. Besides, I would add some awesome features that other file explorers doesn’t support. Aha, Xplorer was born!

### 為何此程式使用JavaScript編寫？
- JavaScript已經成為常用程式語言
- JavaScript有非常多強大的社群
- 您可以輕鬆地使用JavaScript編寫插件
- JavaScript可以在非常多作業系統上運行
- 可以使用Electron加上HTML和CSS編寫出現代介面
- 我C/C++不太好
