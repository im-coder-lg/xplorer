On windows and macOS, Xplorer will copy the file paths into local clipboard, because of this, you can copy file from Xplorer and paste it into an folder in another system. However, on Linux, we create a string of Xplorer commands and copy it into user clipboard, Xplorer will read user's clipboard when pasting file (because we haven't found any idea to implement it, fell free to [open a PR](/community/Contributing/#pull-requests) if you can help us). The string of Xplorer command look like this:

```
Xplorer command - COPY
~/xplorer
~/test
```

:::info THis is done by creating a string of Xplorer command and copy it into user clipboard to be used when pasting file (not integrated with platform because we haven't found any idea, fell free to [open a PR](/community/Contributing/#pull-requests) if you can help us.). The string og Xplorer command look like this:

## Delete files

You can cut files by right clicking it and click `Delete` option or select the file then press `Del` as shortcut. Trashed file can be accessed at `xplorer://Trash`.

:::info

-   On Windows, this is done by creating a `Trash` folder on `C:` drive and moving the file into it.
-   On Linux, this feature is fully integrated with the sytem
-   On macOS, this is done by creating a `.local/Trash` folder on `homedir` and moving the file into it.

We are still working on Windows on macOS to integrate the `Trash` folder, will be released before the stable version came out. fell free to [open a PR](/community/Contributing/#pull-requests) if you can help us.
